    <p>
        My name is JV, and I am from the Philippines. I recently completed the BYU Pathway program and this is my first class at BYUI. My academic goal is to obtain a degree in Software Development, which I believe will help me achieve my aspirations in the field of technology.

        I returned from my missionary service a year ago, during which I had the honor of serving in Utah Ogden and the Philippines Quezon City North Mission during the pandemic. Prior to my missionary service, I had the opportunity to work in the finance and accounting industry, where I had exposure to several projects that involved extensive knowledge of information technology. This experience ignited my interest in software development. I am currently employed as an accountant in an alternative investment company. In the long run, I aspire to establish myself in the fintech industry and apply my combined knowledge in computer programming and finance to make meaningful contributions.

        As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for the past seven years, I have found inspiration in the teachings of the gospel. One of my favorite scriptures, found in 2nd Nephi 2:2, states, "...thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain." This scripture has been a source of comfort and guidance for me, and I strive to embody its message in my personal and professional endeavors.

        I am passionate about the latest technological advancements and their potential to improve our daily lives. Thus, I am excited to pursue this course, which I believe will broaden my horizons and equip me with the necessary skills and knowledge to make a meaningful contribution to society.
